        <h2>How to Play YouTube Roulette</h2>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Joining a Game</h3>
            <p>Start a new game or join an existing one using a unique game code. Choose to play locally or remotely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Players take turns. When it's your turn, a random 4-character search term is generated. Use this term to find videos on YouTube.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Choosing Videos</h3>
            <p>You'll get three standard video options and up to three wildcards (like songs or playlists). Choose one to play for the group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Watching Videos</h3>
            <p>Watch the selected video together. Any player can vote to end the video early, but it takes a majority vote to skip it before one minute has passed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Superpowers</h3>
            <p>Each player has three superpowers to use once per game - Reroll, Replace, and Swap - allowing you to alter the search term to your advantage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>After each round, players vote on their favorite video. The video with the most votes earns its selector one point. A unanimous vote earns two points.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule-card">
            <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
            <p>The first player to reach three points wins. Celebrate your victory, start a new game, or exit.</p>
